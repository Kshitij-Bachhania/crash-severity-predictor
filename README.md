# ğŸš— Crash Severity Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict crash severity based on vehicle impact parameters.

## ğŸ§  Features:
- Trained using regression models (Random Forest, Linear Regression)
- Based on inputs like impact angle, speed, and deformation
- 92% test accuracy

## ğŸ”§ Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ğŸ“ˆ Goal:
Help engineering teams predict crash outcomes early using data.
